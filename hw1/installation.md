## Install MuJoCo and other dependencies locally

There are two options:

A. (Recommended) Install with conda:

    1. Install conda, if you don't already have it, by following the instructions at[this link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

    ```

    This install will modify the`PATH` variable in your bashrc.
	You need to open a new terminal for that path change to take place (to be able to find 'conda' in the next step).

    2. Create a conda environment that will contain python 3:`` 	conda create -n rob831 python=3.10 	``

    3. Activate the environment (do this every time you open a new terminal and want to run code):`` 	source activate rob831 	``

    4. Install the requirements into this conda environment`` 	pip install --user -r requirements.txt 	``

    5. Allow your code to be able to see 'rob831'`` 	cd <path_to_hw1> 	$ pip install -e . 	``
Note: if you run into a `DependencyNotInstalled` error with GLIBC, run `conda install -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng>=14 libgcc-ng>=14 -y` after creating the conda env and before installing the packages (between step 3 and 4).

This conda environment requires activating it every time you open a new terminal (in order to run code), but the benefit is that the required dependencies for this codebase will not affect existing/other versions of things on your computer. This stand-alone environment will have everything that is necessary.

B. Install on system Python:

    `` 		pip install -r requirements.txt  	   	cd <path_to_hw1>  	   	pip install -e .pyenv 	``

## Common installation errors

Mujoco-py versions above 2 are now deprecated for Windows. We recommend using Linux or running on colab.

### Linux/Ubuntu

If an error appears when installing mujoco-py: `No such file or directory: 'patchelf'`, try installing patchelf first:

```
sudo apt-get install patchelf
```

During mujoco-py install, if `fatal error: GL/osmesa.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated` appears, run:

```
$ sudo apt-get install libosmesa6-dev
```

### Mac

If installing requirements.txt fails to build matplotlib, install it separately without specifying version number:

```
pip uninstall matplotlib
pip install matplotlib
```

### Mac M1

Successfully installing and running Mujoco on Mac M1 may require some additional overhead. Make sure home-brew is [installed correctly](https://blog.smittytone.net/2021/02/07/how-to-migrate-to-native-homebrew-on-an-m1-mac/) and see the installation guides below for help:
